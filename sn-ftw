# pseudocode for algorithm of Systematic Cooperation with Future Time Windows

Set the duration of simulation to T_s
Set the size of future time windows to t_w
Load the route set P_all
Initialize x ̂_l^h (1)=0,(l∈[1,L],h∈N^+)
For t = 1, T_s do
  Obtain all vehicles V enter the network at time t
  For all veh in V do
    Take P_i from P_all according to the OD of veh
    travel_time = []
    time_windows = []
    For all route in P_i do
      Calculate the travel time t_r of the route and the time h_r that veh enters links
      travel_time.add(t_r)
      time_windows.add(round(h_r/t_w))
    End For
    Calculate probability P according to travel_time
    If veh does not obey our navigation then
      With probability P select a random route r_act as the actual route of veh
      With probability P select a random route r_sys as the calculating route for veh
    Else
      Select the route r_sys whose travel time is the lowest for veh
    End If
    Update x ̂_l^h according to r_sys and its time windows corresponding to r_sys selected from time_windows 
  End For
  h_c=round(t/t_w)
  For all links e_l in E do
    Obtain the actual number of vehicles x_l^t at time t on the link e_l
    Calculate the δ=x_l^t-x ̂_l^t
    time_windows = []
    If δ==0 then 
      Continue
    Else
      For i=1, abs(δ) do
        If δ>0 then
          Calculate the travel time t_l according to temp_x=x ̂_l^t+i-1
        Else
          Calculate the travel time t_l according to temp_x=i-1
        End If
        time_windows.add(round((t_l+t)/t_w))

      For h_l in time_windows do
        For h=h_c,h_l do 
          x ̂_l^h=x ̂_l^h+δ/abs(δ)

/*
In this algorithm, when we adjust our estimation, we calculate different temp_x according to δ, 
because we consider that if δ>0, which means there are more vehicles enter that link, 
we should factor those vehicles into our estimation, and if δ<0, 
which means some vehicles leave that link early and those must be the vehicles which enter the link early, 
that is why we calculate it from zero.
